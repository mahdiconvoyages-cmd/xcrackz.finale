## ⚠️ Known Issues

### CMake Clean Error (NOT a Java issue)
When running `gradlew clean`, you may see CMake errors about missing directories. This is **normal** and **unrelated to Java 21**. These are React Native codegen directories that get regenerated during builds.

**Solution:** Don't run `clean` - go directly to `assembleDebug` or `assembleRelease`.
